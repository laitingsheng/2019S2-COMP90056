abstract = "In this paper we give a construction of a small approximately min-wise independent family of hash functions, i.e., a family of hash functions such that for any set of arguments X and x∈X, the probability that the value of a random function from that family on x will be the smallest among all values of that function on X is roughly 1/|X|. The number of bits needed to represent each function is O(logn·log1/ϵ). This construction gives a solution to the main open problem of A. Broder et al. (in “STOC'98”)."
